# Prompt Design in Vertex AI: Challenge Lab

## Task 1. Build a Gemini image analysis tool

Prompt:

```
Describe image
```

- Short, descriptive text inspired by the image.

```
Describe image in 20 words
```

- Catchy phrases suitable for advertisements.

```
You are a marketing staff and would like to create an advertising campaign for eco-tourism area. Describe an image in 20 words to support this campaign.
```

- A poetic description for a nature-focused campaign.

```
Describe image in 20 words in poetic style
```

## Task 2. Build a Gemini tagline generator

### Example Tagline

```
Input: Write a tagline for a durable backpack designed for hikers that makes them feel prepared. Consider styles like playful.
Output: Adventure starts where Wi-Fi ends!
```

### Parameters

Thay đổi một số paramter sau:

- Explanation: Temperature controls randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.0-0.2) make the output more focused and deterministic. Higher values (e.g., 1.5-2) encourage more diverse or creative responses.
- Output Token Limit: This sets the maximum number of tokens (parts of words) the model can generate for its response.
- Top-P: Top-P (nucleus sampling) also controls randomness. It considers only the most probable tokens whose combined probability mass exceeds the Top-P value. A value of 1.0 considers all tokens. Lowering Top-P (e.g., to 0.8) makes the output more focused, similar to lowering temperature.

- Safety Filter Settings: These are active by default to help block harmful content. For this lab, you'll use the default settings.
- Thinking Budget: This parameter guides the model on the number of thinking tokens to use when generating a response. A higher token count generally allows for more detailed reasoning, which can be beneficial for tackling more complex tasks. It defaults to Auto, but can also be set to Off or Manual. When set to Manual, the model stops analyzing after reaching the specified token limit; you can set a lower limit for simpler tasks and a higher limit for more complex ones.
- Structured output: Forces the model to generate a response that strictly follows a predefined schema (like JSON).
- Grounding: Google: Connects the model to Google Search or Maps, enabling it to answer with real-time, public information.
- Grounding: Your data: Allows the model to retrieve information from your own data sources (like Vertex AI Search or RAG Engine) to answer context-specific questions.

## Task 3. Experiment with image analysis code

- Chạy dòng upgrade đầu tiên, xong chọn Kernel trên menu -> restart kernel

### Modify the image analysis prompt

- Create client theo code sau

```python
client = genai.Client(
    vertexai=True,
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1")
)
```

- Thêm "describe image in 10 words" rồi chạy lại
- Thêm "in creative way"

### Task 4. Experiment with tagline generation code

Prompt

- Create client theo code sau

```python
client = genai.Client(
    vertexai=True,
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1")
)
```

- Thêm "each tagline must include keyword nature"
